I am a first-year Master student at [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Linghe Kong](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~linghe.kong/). Previously, I received my B.E degree from SJTU in 2022.

My research interest is computer vision focusing on image restoration (e.g., super-resolution, deblurring). I have a close collaboration with Dr. [Yulun Zhang](https://yulunzhang.com/).
