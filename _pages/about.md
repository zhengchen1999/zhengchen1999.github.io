I am a second-year PhD student at the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)](https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Yulun Zhang](https://yulunzhang.com/). Previously, I received my B.E. degree from SJTU in 2022. My master's advisor is Prof. [Linghe Kong](https://www.cs.sjtu.edu.cn/~linghe.kong/).

My research interest is computer vision, including image/video restoration (e.g., super-resolution, deblurring), image quality assessment, diffusion model, model compression (e.g., binarization), and multimodal learning.
